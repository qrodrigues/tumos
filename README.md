Tumos
Tumos is a single-player word guessing game inspired by the classic French game, Motus. The game is developed entirely in Vue.js by [Your Name], and is a great way to test your vocabulary and improve your word-guessing skills!

Gameplay
In Tumos, the player must guess a five-letter word within eight tries. After each guess, the game provides feedback in the form of colored dots to indicate which letters in the guess are in the correct position (green dot) and which letters are present in the word, but not in the correct position (yellow dot). The game ends either when the player correctly guesses the word or after eight unsuccessful attempts.
